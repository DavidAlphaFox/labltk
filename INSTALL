                    Installing LablTk from sources
                    ------------------------------

PREREQUISITES

* OCaml (>= 4.02) should be installed

* Tcl/Tk (>= 8.03) should be installed

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNIX AND OSX

1- Configure the system. From the top directory, do:

        ./configure

In case of success, this generates config/Makefile which contains the
OCaml library path and compilation options.

The "configure" script accepts the following options:

-libdir <dir>                   (default: `ocamlc -where`)
        Directory where the OCaml library was installed,
        where Makefile.config can be found.

-tkdefs <cpp flags>             (default: none)
-tklibs <flags and libraries>   (default: determined automatically)
        These options specify where to find the Tcl/Tk libraries for
        LablTk. "-tkdefs" helps to find the headers, and "-tklibs"
        the C libraries. "-tklibs" may contain either only -L/path and
        -Wl,... flags, in which case the library names are determined
        automatically, or the actual libraries, which are used as given.
        Examples:
        for an OSX installation using macports, use just
         ./configure -tklibs -L/opt/local/lib -tkdefs -I/opt/local/include
        for Japanese Tcl/Tk whose headers are in specific directories
        and libraries in /usr/local/lib, you can use
         ./configure -tklibs "-L/usr/local/lib -ltk8.0jp -ltcl8.0jp"
          -tkdefs "-I/usr/local/include/tcl8.0jp -I/usr/local/include/tk8.0jp"

-tk-no-x11
        Build LablTk without using X11. This option is needed on
        Cygwin, or if you want to use the Quartz version on Tk on OSX.

-verbose
        Verbose output of the configuration tests. Use it if the outcome
        of configure is not what you were expecting.

2- From the top directory do

        make all

and optionally

        make opt

3- From the top directory do

        make install

It will install labltk inside the OCaml distribution.
You may need to become superuser first.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS

1- In the config subdirectory, overwrite Makefile with the file
corresponding to your system

2- Continue from step 2 above
